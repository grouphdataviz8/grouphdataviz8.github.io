            <p>Classifying where an electric scooter is ridden based on data from Accelerometer and Gyroscope measurements. </br>
            <p>Electric scooters are becoming ubiqitous in major cities (Lime, Spin, Voi etc) </br>
            <p>These scooters are only supposed to be ridden on streets or bikelanes - can we, with the help of a machine learning model, classify whether a person is riding on the sidewalk (illegal) vs street (legal)? </br>
            <p>An electric scooter was ridden on streets and sidewalks around Champaign </br>
